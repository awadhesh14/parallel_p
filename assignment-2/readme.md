This is an implementation of SSSP (bellman ford) 
the impplementation is done for 
1. SEQUENTIAL
2. TOPOLOGY DRIVEN (PARALLEL)
3. DATA DRIVEN (PARALLEL)
the times of execution are compared


to run:
  go into main:
    make

distances are in results folder
times of execution are in times folder


these are for my use :P
```
At turing-gpu
```
  In parallel_p
    git fetch --all
    git reset --hard origin/master
    git pull
```

At local
```
  In Assignment-2
    git add *
    git commit -m "hello mom"
    git push
```

To Run
```
  In Sequential-SSSP
    g++ -w sssp.c
    ./a.out > output
```
```
